I have a background in engineering and mathematics, and I've been spiraling towards data science for quite some time. I have moved from astrophysics > planetary science > applied mathematics > engineering > environmental engineering > sediment remediation. The issue was that I enjoyed it all. I knew I was looking for something specific that all of those disciplines offered, but what was it? After reflecting on my favorite projects, I found a pretty distinct pattern:

* Researching filtering methodologies to reduce distortions in images of Mars at HiRISE ([pub](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318822628_CORRECTING_SPACECRAFT_JITTER_IN_HIRISE_IMAGES?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_treasury%3BNWVkUH78Q2%2BuRMlRGM2rug%3D%3D))
* Implementing a process model for a solar desalination system and using a genetic algorithm to optimize system performance ([pub](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26812853?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_treasury%3BOcFmWcrzQ7mkbhV0qvaG2w%3D%3D))
* Creating an environmental impact and benefit analysis tool ([pub](https://onlinelibrarystatic.wiley.com/store/10.1002/ieam.2000/asset/ieam2000.pdf?v=1&t=jawznrbt&s=e492cc8f3a55b91a1993e911f39c01c3b8306960))

I realized that I loved anything that included applied math, programming, and creative problem-solving. That seemed like a mega-blanket statement, and I thought that no career would fulfill my interdisciplinary expectations -- until I found **data science**. I recently completed a three-month data science immersive at Galvanize, where I got my hands dirty with Python/SQL, statistics, data munging and visualization, and machine learning. Having graduated in November 2017, I'm now working on personal projects, teaching myself R, and beefing up my SQL skills as I look for the perfect company to help grow with my new skill set.

That's me ^

I don’t particularly like writing about myself (I have been told that I write like a robot), but since this is *my* “about me” page, I figure this is my only opportunity to summarize myself using bullets: 

* Tucson, AZ -> Seattle, WA, lover of the SW and PNW
* Hobbies (in no particular order): climbing, hiking, silversmithing, lifting, online shopping and critiquing recommender systems, traveling, eating, yoga-ing(?), drinking coffee in the sunshine, and attempting to love running, but not doing so hot on that front
* If I were a superhero I’d be **Question-Woman**
* INTJ Slytherin Earth-bender
