I have a background in engineering and mathematics, and I've been spiraling towards data science for quite some time. I have moved from astrophysics > planetary science > applied mathematics > engineering > environmental engineering > sediment remediation. The problem was that I enjoyed it all. I knew I was looking for something specific that all of those disciplines offered, but what was it? After reflecting on my favorite projects, I found a pretty distinct pattern:

* Researching filtering methodologies to reduce distortions in images of Mars at HiRISE
* Implementing a process model for a solar desalination system and using a genetic algorithm to optimize system performance
* Creating an environmental impact and benefit analysis tool

I realized that I loved anything that included applied math, programming, and creative problem-solving. That seemed like a mega-blanket statement, and I thought that no career would fulfill my interdisciplinary expectations -- until I found **data science**. I attended Galvanize’s 3-month data science immersive, where I had the chance to get my hands dirty with Python/SQL, statistics, data munging and visualization, and machine learning. I graduated in November 2017, and now I’m working on my own projects, teaching myself R, and beefing up my SQL skills.

That's me ^

I don’t particularly like writing about myself (my partner tells me I write like a robot), but since this is *my* “about me” page, I figure this is my only opportunity to summarize myself using bullets: 

* Tucson, AZ -> Seattle, WA, lover of the SW and PNW
* Hobbies (in no particular order): climbing, hiking, silversmithing, lifting, online shopping and critiquing recommender systems, traveling, eating, yoga-ing(?), and attempting to love running, but not doing so hot on that front
* If I were a superhero I’d be **Question-Woman**
* INTJ Slytherin Earth-bender
